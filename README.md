# Crossword Editor

## Basic Functionality

The Crossword Editor allows you to build out a customized crossword for others to enjoy! Here's some key features I built out:
* Design your grid by switching between black and white squares with a single click
* Type letters directly into each square â€” with smart keyboard navigation, auto-tab, and backspace handling
* Write and organize clues in a dedicated side panel that updates live with your grid
* See real-time pattern validation so your puzzles are structurally solid
  * More specifically, I use standard unwritten crossword rules here - each word has to be 3+ letters in length
* Export your crossword to the iPuZ format, where you can add a custom title, author, and clues
  * Here's [an example site](https://viresh-ratnakar.github.io/exolve-player.html) where you can upload your ipuz for printing and/or playing
 
## Coming Soon

* Save drafts of your crossword to a database to come back to later
* More options for the shape of your crossword + adding themed entries and rhebus squares
* Linking out puzzles to friends directly
* Better mobile UI
